            <p>In a world of digital noise, silence is a luxury. When a user lands on a website, their cognitive load is often already at capacity. Minimalism isn't just an aesthetic choice; it's a functional one.</p>

            <h3>The Power of Whitespace</h3>
            <p>Whitespace, or negative space, allows content to breathe. It guides the eye naturally from one element to the next, creating a hierarchy that feels intuitive rather than forced. By removing the non-essential, we amplify the signal of what truly matters.</p>

            <p>Studies show that users judge a website's credibility within 50 milliseconds. A clean, uncluttered interface signals professionalism, clarity, and confidence.</p>

            <h3>Typography as Interface</h3>
            <p>When you strip away decoration, typography becomes the interface itself. The choice of typeface, the leading, and the tracking all communicate the brand's voice before a single word is read.</p>

            <p>At St. Clair Design Co., we believe that every pixel should serve a purpose. If it doesn't help the user achieve their goal, it doesn't belong on the screen.</p>
